# Official Material Design Icon SVGs

A fork of [google-material-design-icons-updated](https://github.com/cyberalien/google-material-design-icons-updated), which contains (at the time of writing) all the official icons (including the ones not included in the official Google repo).

Features:

 * Only svgs included to reduce size
 * Flattened structure with category dirs removed
 * Baseline icons have `baseline-` removed so can access directly by name
 * All icons at root level of package so can access via e.g. `node_modules/md-icon-svgs/done.svg`
 * This package isn't registered, just import it via the tarball:
    * `npm install https://github.com/shadow-light/md-icon-svgs/tarball/master`
